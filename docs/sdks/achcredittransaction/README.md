# ACHCreditTransaction
(*ACHCreditTransaction*)

### Available Operations

* [Create](#create) - ACH Credit transactions.

## Create

Initiate an <b>ACH</b> credit transaction request to Netevia Gateway.<sup>1</sup><br>
An <b>ACH</b> credit transaction is used to allow merchants to pay using ACH and transfer money to other bank accounts.<br>
To be more generic and have a similar approach as for Debit ACH, we can also simulate the single PayOut call for a batch of payments with multiple individual credit transactions calls that will be approved offline by us and when batching happens we can generate the PayOut request to GMS as a single API call(batch file upload) as they require. Now GMS processor support.

<sup>1</sup>Use the examples for different 'ACH Credit' request flavours.
